Automated Hand Sanitizer Dispenser Project

Project Overview

The Automated Hand Sanitizer Dispenser is designed to encourage hygiene by dispensing hand sanitizer automatically when a hand is detected near the sensor.
This project makes use of an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, and a motor-driven pump controlled by a BC547 transistor.

Components Used:

Arduino Uno
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
BC547 transistor
12V motor pump
9V batteries
Resistors
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Power supply (9V battery)
Circuit Diagram
Ensure your circuit is connected as follows:

Ultrasonic sensor:
VCC -> 5V on Arduino
GND -> GND on Arduino
Trig pin -> Digital pin 7 on Arduino
Echo pin -> Digital pin 6 on Arduino
BC547 Transistor:
Base -> Digital pin 9 through a 1kÎ© resistor
Collector -> Negative terminal of the motor
Emitter -> GND
Motor Pump:
Positive terminal -> Positive end of 12V power supply
Negative terminal -> Collector of BC547 transistor


The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to detect when a hand is placed near the dispenser (between 5-10 cm). 
The Arduino then triggers the motor through the BC547 transistor, turning the pump on to dispense sanitizer. The pump turns off once the hand is removed.

Benefits:
Touchless Operation: Reduces the risk of contamination.
Cost-effective: Utilizes basic components to create an efficient system.
Encourages Hygiene: Promotes consistent use of sanitizer.

Digital Electronics Application:
This project applies digital electronics by using the Arduino microcontroller for sensor input processing and motor control, 
showcasing how digital logic can drive practical solutions for everyday problems.
