Automated Hand Sanitizer Dispenser Project

Project Overview:
The Automated Hand Sanitizer Dispenser is designed to encourage hygiene by dispensing hand sanitizer automatically when a hand is detected near the sensor. 
This project makes use of an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, and a motor-driven pump controlled by a BC547 transistor.

Components Used:

Arduino Uno
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
BC547 transistor
12V motor pump
9V batteries
Resistors
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Power supply (9V battery)

Circuit Diagram
Ensure your circuit is connected as follows:

Ultrasonic sensor:

VCC -> 5V on Arduino
GND -> GND on Arduino
Trig pin -> Digital pin 7 on Arduino
Echo pin -> Digital pin 6 on Arduino

BC547 Transistor:
Base -> Digital pin 9 through a 1kÎ© resistor
Collector -> Negative terminal of the motor
Emitter -> GND

Motor Pump:
Positive terminal -> Positive end of 12V power supply
Negative terminal -> Collector of BC547 transistor
